# Setting Up Your Nervos CKB Development Environment

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- **Understand** the different options for setting up a Nervos CKB development environment
- **Install** the necessary tools to start developing on Nervos
- **Configure** a local CKB devnet for testing and development
- **Connect** to the CKB network using JavaScript/TypeScript tools
- **Validate** your setup to ensure everything is working correctly
- **Know** the essential development workflow for CKB projects

## Development Environment Options

When developing for Nervos CKB, you have several options for your environment setup:

1. **Local Development Chain** - Running your own local CKB node for development
2. **Testnet** - Connecting to the public Nervos testnet
3. **Mainnet** - Connecting to the production Nervos mainnet

For beginners, a local development environment is highly recommended as it gives you complete control without worrying about testnet tokens or block intervals.

## Installing Essential Tools

### 1. OffCKB CLI Tool (Recommended Approach)

The simplest way to get started is with OffCKB, an all-in-one tool that quickly sets up a local development environment with pre-configured settings.

First, make sure you have Node.js installed (version 20.0.0 or higher):

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version
```

If you need to install or upgrade Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Next, install the OffCKB CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g @offckb/cli
```

**Note:** For Windows users, you may need to run your terminal as Administrator for a global installation.

### 2. Verify OffCKB Installation

Check that OffCKB has been installed properly:

```bash
offckb --version
```

You should see the version number displayed, confirming successful installation.

## Setting Up Your Local CKB Devnet

### 1. Start the CKB Devnet

The OffCKB tool makes it easy to start a local CKB blockchain node:

```bash
offckb node
```

When successful, you'll see output similar to:

```
Launching CKB devnet Node...
CKB devnet RPC Proxy server running on http://localhost:28114
```

Your local blockchain is now running with:
- A pre-configured CKB node
- Pre-funded test accounts
- Common scripts already deployed (like Omnilock)

**Note:** To stop the node, press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal. When you want to restart, simply run `offckb node` again to continue where you left off.

### 2. Clean Blockchain State (When Needed)

If you need to start fresh with a clean blockchain, run:

```bash
offckb clean
```

This removes all existing blockchain data, allowing you to start from a fresh genesis block.

## Setting Up JavaScript/TypeScript Development Environment

Since you're interested in dApp development with JavaScript/TypeScript, let's set up the necessary tools:

### 1. Create a Project Directory

```bash
mkdir my-ckb-project
cd my-ckb-project
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install the CKB SDK for JavaScript

```bash
npm install @nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-core
```

### 3. Create a Simple Connection Test

Create a file named `test-connection.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const CKB = require('@nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-core').default;

// Connect to your local devnet
const nodeUrl = 'http://localhost:28114';
const ckb = new CKB(nodeUrl);

async function testConnection() {
  try {
    // Try to get blockchain information
    const blockchainInfo = await ckb.rpc.getBlockchainInfo();
    console.log('Successfully connected to CKB node!');
    console.log('Blockchain info:', JSON.stringify(blockchainInfo, null, 2));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to CKB node:', error.message);
  }
}

testConnection();
```

Run the test script to verify your connection:

```bash
node test-connection.js
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see blockchain information displayed in your console.

## Creating Your First CKB Contract Project

OffCKB makes it easy to create a new contract project with all the necessary boilerplate:

```bash
offckb create my-first-contract -c hello-world
```

This creates a new project with:
- A template contract in Rust
- Build scripts configured
- Test fixtures ready to go
- Documentation in the README.md file

Follow the instructions in the generated README.md to build, test, and deploy your contract.

## Check Your Understanding

Try connecting to your local CKB node using the JavaScript SDK. Can you modify the `test-connection.js` script to retrieve the following information?

1. The current tip block number
2. The number of transactions in the latest block

**Hint:** Look for RPC methods like `getTipBlockNumber()` and `getBlock()` in the CKB SDK documentation.
