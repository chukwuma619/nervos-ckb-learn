## What is Nervos Network?

Nervos Network is a public blockchain ecosystem focused on providing sustainable, secure infrastructure for the decentralized economy. Launched in 2018, Nervos takes a unique approach to blockchain architecture by implementing a multi-layered system designed to address the blockchain trilemma—achieving scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.

At its core, Nervos aims to serve as a secure value storage platform for the emerging decentralized economy while enabling flexible and scalable applications through its layered design.

### The Vision of Nervos

Nervos was created with a specific vision: to build a truly decentralized network that serves as a secure store of value while enabling unlimited application functionality. The founders recognized that a single-layer blockchain cannot optimally serve both purposes without significant trade-offs.

As co-founder Kevin Wang explained, "We designed Nervos to be the foundation for a universal public network that can fulfill Bitcoin's promise as decentralized money while extending capabilities to power the decentralized applications of the future."

## The Nervos Architecture

Nervos implements a multi-layered architecture, with distinct layers serving different purposes:

1. **Layer 1 (CKB)**: The Common Knowledge Base serves as the secure foundation for storing assets and verifying computations. This is the base consensus layer.

2. **Layer 2 Solutions**: Various layer 2 networks and sidechains that provide scalability for different use cases.

Let's examine each layer in more detail.

### Layer 1: Nervos CKB

The Nervos CKB (Common Knowledge Base) is the foundational layer of the Nervos ecosystem. It is a proof-of-work blockchain that prioritizes security and decentralization.

Key features of CKB include:

1. **Cell Model**: Instead of the account-based model used in Ethereum, CKB uses a cell model similar to Bitcoin's UTXO system but extended to support more complex states and scripts.

2. **CKByte**: The native token of the network, which represents state storage capacity on the blockchain.

3. **Proof-of-Work Consensus**: CKB uses a modified version of Bitcoin's consensus algorithm called NC-MAX (Nervos-Consensus Maximum) that provides security while mitigating some of the energy concerns of traditional PoW.

4. **Turing-complete VM**: The CKB-VM is a RISC-V based virtual machine that allows for flexible and secure smart contract programming.

```
// Simple example of a cell structure in CKB
{
  capacity: 100 CKBytes,
  lock: <script that controls who can use this cell>,
  type: <optional script that defines the cell's type>,
  data: <the data stored in this cell>
}
```

#### Notes

The cell model provides significant flexibility compared to account-based systems. Each cell is like a small container that can hold any kind of data and is protected by scripts that determine how it can be used. This approach enables efficient verification and improved security for complex applications.

### Layer 2: Scalability Solutions

While CKB prioritizes security and decentralization, Layer 2 solutions on Nervos provide the scalability needed for high-throughput applications:

1. **Godwoken**: A rollup-based layer 2 solution with EVM compatibility, allowing Ethereum developers to deploy their applications on Nervos with minimal changes.

2. **Axon**: A sidechain framework designed for application-specific chains.

3. **Force Bridge**: A cross-chain bridge that enables asset transfers between Nervos and other blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cardano.

This layered approach allows Nervos to achieve high scalability while maintaining the security guarantees of the base layer.

## Economic Model: Addressing State Bloat

One of the most innovative aspects of Nervos is its economic model, designed to address the "state bloat" problem that affects many blockchains.

### State Occupancy and NervosDAO

In Nervos, storing data on the blockchain requires locking CKBytes proportional to the storage space. This creates a direct economic cost for occupying state.

The model includes:

1. **State Rent**: Through inflation, users who occupy blockchain state pay an ongoing "rent" in the form of dilution of their CKByte holdings.

2. **NervosDAO**: A mechanism that allows CKByte holders who are not occupying state to deposit their tokens and receive interest that offsets inflation, effectively making state occupiers the only ones who pay the inflation tax.

```
// Example of depositing into NervosDAO
{
  capacity: 1000 CKBytes,
  lock: <NervosDAO lock script>,
  type: <NervosDAO type script>,
  data: <deposit information>
}
```

This economic model creates a sustainable system where those who use the blockchain's scarce resource (state storage) bear the cost of maintaining it.

## Problems Nervos Aims to Solve

Nervos Network was designed to address several critical challenges in the blockchain ecosystem:

### 1. The Store of Value vs. Platform Dilemma

Bitcoin excels as a store of value but has limited programmability. Ethereum provides powerful programmability but faces scalability issues and potentially higher security risks due to its complexity.

Nervos separates these concerns across its layers, with Layer 1 optimized for secure value storage and Layer 2 for flexible applications.

### 2. State Bloat

Most blockchains suffer from state growth over time, where the blockchain's state database grows continuously, increasing the resources required to run a full node and threatening decentralization.

Nervos addresses this through its economic model that imposes costs on state occupation, creating incentives to minimize state usage and clean up unnecessary data.

### 3. Interoperability

Blockchain ecosystems often operate as isolated islands with limited connection to each other. Nervos aims to serve as a hub for the decentralized economy, connecting various blockchain networks.

Through solutions like Force Bridge and a UTXO-inspired cell model that is adaptable to different blockchain paradigms, Nervos facilitates true interoperability.

### 4. Developer Flexibility

Nervos provides unusual flexibility for developers:

- The CKB-VM is based on RISC-V, an open standard instruction set architecture, allowing developers to use many programming languages.
- The cell model enables developers to create custom cryptographic primitives and verification logic directly on the base layer.

## Nervos in the Blockchain Ecosystem

To understand Nervos's position in the broader blockchain landscape, let's compare it with other prominent platforms:

| Platform | Consensus | State Model | Smart Contracts | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Bitcoin | PoW | UTXO | Limited | Store of Value |
| Ethereum | PoS | Account | Turing-complete | World Computer |
| Polkadot | NPoS | Various (parachains) | Various | Interoperability |
| Nervos | PoW | Cell | Flexible VM | Layered Economy |

Nervos combines elements from Bitcoin's security model with advanced programming capabilities, creating a unique position as both a secure value storage layer and a platform for complex applications.

## Check your understanding

Consider how Nervos handles state storage compared to Ethereum:

In Ethereum, users pay gas fees for transactions, but once data is stored on-chain, there's no ongoing cost for keeping it there. How does Nervos's approach differ, and what problem does this aim to solve?
