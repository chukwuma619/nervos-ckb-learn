# Working with CKB-CLI: A Command-Line Interface for Nervos CKB

## Learning outcomes

- **Understand** what CKB-CLI is and its role in the Nervos ecosystem
- **Install and configure** CKB-CLI in your development environment
- **Generate** new CKB addresses and key pairs using CKB-CLI
- **Check balances** of CKB addresses and understand the output format
- **Transfer CKBytes** between addresses using command-line operations
- **Execute** common blockchain operations through the CKB-CLI interface

## What is CKB-CLI?

CKB-CLI (Command Line Interface) is a versatile tool for interacting with the Nervos CKB blockchain. It allows developers to perform common operations such as creating accounts, checking balances, transferring tokens, and querying blockchain data—all through a simple command-line interface.

Think of CKB-CLI as your direct connection to the Nervos blockchain, providing functions that would normally require a graphical wallet, but in a format that's scriptable and automation-friendly.

### Why Use CKB-CLI?

While there are graphical wallets available for CKB (such as Neuron, Portal Wallet, and CKBull), CKB-CLI offers several advantages for developers:

1. **Script automation** of blockchain interactions
2. **Direct access** to CKB's features without GUI overhead
3. **Simplified testing** in development environments
4. **Integration capabilities** with development workflows

**Note:** CKB-CLI is primarily intended for development and testing purposes. For managing real assets on mainnet, consider using a secure wallet with proper key management.

## Installing CKB-CLI

CKB-CLI is available in two ways:
1. As a standalone tool
2. Bundled with the CKB Node software

For most development purposes, using OffCKB CLI (which we covered in the previous lesson) is the simplest approach, as it includes a local devnet with CKB-CLI capabilities. However, if you need the standalone version, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using OffCKB (Recommended for Beginners)

If you've already set up OffCKB from the previous lesson, you can access CKB-CLI functionality through it:

```bash
npx @offckb/cli accounts
npx @offckb/cli balance
```

### Option 2: Direct Download (For Advanced Users)

1. Download the latest release from the [CKB GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases)
2. Extract the files to a directory
3. Add the directory to your PATH or navigate to it in your terminal
4. Verify installation:

```bash
ckb-cli --version
```

## Basic CKB-CLI Operations

Let's explore some of the most common operations you can perform with CKB-CLI.

### Generating a New Account

To create a new account (key pair and address):

```bash
ckb-cli account new
```

You'll be prompted to create a password to protect this account. After creation, you'll see output similar to:

```
Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
Password:
Repeat password:
address:
  mainnet: ckb1qyq...
  testnet: ckt1qyq...
lock_arg: 0x...
```

**Note:** Make sure to save the address, lock_arg, and password in a secure place. The password is required for transactions, and the lock_arg is needed for mining configuration.

### Checking Account Balances

To check the balance of an address:

```bash
ckb-cli wallet get-capacity --address <address>
```

Replace `<address>` with your CKB address. The output will show:

```
immature: 0.0 (CKB)
total: 1000.0 (CKB)
```

- **immature** refers to recently mined CKBytes that aren't yet spendable
- **total** is the total balance including both mature and immature CKBytes

### Understanding CKB Address Format

CKB addresses have a specific format. The prefix indicates the network:
- `ckb1` - Mainnet addresses
- `ckt1` - Testnet addresses

For example:
`ckt1qzda0cr08m85hc8jlnfp3zer7xulejywt49kt2rr0vthywaa50xwsqvqqc6nhrq0wj8832ttnlse68ht0enpmsc9astaf`

This long string encodes the public key hash and other information needed to verify ownership using the private key.

### Transferring CKBytes

To transfer CKBytes from one address to another:

```bash
ckb-cli wallet transfer --from-account <your-address> --to-address <recipient-address> --capacity <amount> --max-tx-fee <fee>
```

Parameters:
- `--from-account` - Your CKB address
- `--to-address` - The recipient's CKB address
- `--capacity` - Amount to send in CKBytes (e.g., 100)
- `--max-tx-fee` - Maximum transaction fee you're willing to pay (e.g., 0.00001)

Example:
```bash
ckb-cli wallet transfer --from-account ckt1qyqg6cnaankwgwvh0gaq49uptd3aawhl9p6qpg5cus --to-address ckt1qyq0g9p6nxf5cdy38fm35zech5f90jl5aueqnsxch5 --capacity 100 --max-tx-fee 0.00001
```

You'll be prompted for your password, and upon success, you'll see a transaction hash (something like `0x1b66aafaaba5ce34de494f60374ef78e8f536bb3af9cab4fa63c0f29374c3f89`).

#### Notes on Capacity and Fees

- **Capacity** in CKB-CLI is typically specified in CKBytes (1 CKByte = 10^8 shannon)
- The minimum amount for a basic transfer is approximately 61 CKBytes (this covers the minimum cell capacity)
- **Shannon** is the smallest unit of CKBytes (similar to satoshis in Bitcoin)

## Working with OffCKB (Simplified Approach)

If you're using OffCKB from our previous lesson, many operations are simplified. Here are the equivalent commands:

### Check Account Balance

```bash
npx @offckb/cli balance
```

### Transfer CKBytes

```bash
npx @offckb/cli transfer <recipient-address> <amount-in-ckb>
```

Example:
```bash
npx @offckb/cli transfer ckt1qzda0cr08m85hc8jlnfp3zer7xulejywt49kt2rr0vthywaa50xwsqvqqc6nhrq0wj8832ttnlse68ht0enpmsc9astaf 100
```

### List Available Accounts

```bash
npx @offckb/cli accounts
```

## Check Your Understanding

Try this exercise: Using CKB-CLI (or OffCKB CLI), generate a new address, then transfer a small amount (e.g., 100 CKBytes) from one of your existing accounts to this new address. After that, check the balance of both addresses to confirm the transfer was successful.

Ask yourself:
- What does the transaction hash represent?
- How long did the transaction take to confirm?
- What happens to the change amount (the remaining balance) after the transaction?
